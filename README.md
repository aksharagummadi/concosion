# Stickman Memory Quest

A lightweight, browser-based adventure game where you play as a confused, cartoony stickman with a concussion who has forgotten how to do everything — even what words mean. Talk nonsense, help people, and regain your memories one funny task at a time.

## 🧠 Gameplay Summary

- You wake up in a hospital as a stickman with a concussion.
- You only remember how to speak... sort of. Most of your words come out hilariously wrong.
- By helping quirky characters in the city, you slowly regain memories like how to walk, eat, or use common objects.
- Dialogue becomes clearer and abilities unlock as you progress.
- It’s silly, sweet, and designed to be fun and easy to share.
